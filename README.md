# Malon-Global-Technologies-Assesement
This is an assessment done for Malon Global Technologies
It is a login page designed and coded using HTML and CSS.
Every part of the page is handcoded using pure CSS and one of the CSS Pre-processors(SASS) and no CSS framework/library used. As a result of using SASS as the pre-processor, in order to test/run this project all you actually need is to run:

# npm install 
This will intall the neccessary npm packages needed to get the project to run.
Thereafter, run the command:-> npm run compile:sass
# live-server
You will also need # live-server installed on to launch server to run the web page in your local machine.
Having install live-server, run the command -> live-server in the project's root directory.

Have fun!
I had mine!
